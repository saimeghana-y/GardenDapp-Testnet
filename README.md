# Demo App

This project demonstrates how to use the [Garden SDK](https://docs.garden.finance/developers/sdk/) to create a simple dApp for swapping from WBTC to BTC.

> [!NOTE]
> For better developer experience, we are conducting the swap on a local network, but you can do the same on Testnet or Mainnet by changing the parameters.

## Features

- **Swap Interface**: Easily swap from WBTC to BTC and from BTC to WBTC.
- **Transaction Management**: Track and display the latest transactions.
- **Garden SDK Integration**: Uses Garden SDK to make the swap possible.
- **State Management**: We use [zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for state management.
